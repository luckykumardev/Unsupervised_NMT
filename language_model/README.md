# Language Model

This language model is depended on [Word-level language modeling RNN - pytorch/examples](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/word_language_model). To train it, just use the code here and follow the steps provided there.

### Usage

Reload pre-trained model and dictionary first, and use `get_prob()` to get language model probability.
